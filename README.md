## 🛠️ How EcoTicker Works

When you visit a product page and press the "Analyze Sustainability" button in the extension, the following process occurs:

- The backend uses **axios** to fetch the product page HTML.
- It uses **cheerio** to parse the HTML and extract the main text content (removing scripts, nav, etc.).
- The backend builds a prompt for OpenAI using the scraped text, product name, and your evaluation metric.
- It sends the prompt to OpenAI (using your API key from `.env`).
- The backend expects a JSON response with an overall score and summary.
- The result is returned to the popup.
- The extension displays a score and a quick summary to the user.
- *(Yet to implement)*: Recommend more sustainable alternatives.
- *(Yet to implement backend)*: Reward System, earning EcoPoints for sustainable shopping which is tracked and can be redeemed in the popup.

## 📊 Sustainability Metric

EcoTicker's scoring system is inspired by leading frameworks like Eco-Score, Higg Index, and The Sustainability Consortium. Each category is weighted for a total of 100%:

| Category                  | Weight (%) | Example Criteria                                  |
|---------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Materials Sourcing        | 40         | % recycled/organic/certified materials            |
| Manufacturing Impact      | 20         | Renewable energy, low-impact processes            |
| Product Durability & Use  | 15         | Designed for longevity, repairability, multi-use  |
| End-of-Life & Circularity | 15         | Recyclable, take-back programs, closed-loop efforts|
| Packaging Sustainability  | 10         | Recycled/minimal packaging, certifications        |

- **No info for a category:** Score of -1 for that category.
- **Final grade:**  
  - A = 85–100  
  - B = 70–84  
  - C = 55–69  
  - D = 40–54  
  - F = 5-40

## ⚡ Installation

# EcoTicker Extension & Backend Setup Guide

## 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd EcoTicker
```

## 2. Install Backend Dependencies
```sh
cd server
npm install
```

## 3. Set Up OpenAI API Key
1. In the `server` directory, create a file named `.env`.
2. Add your OpenAI API key to the file:
   ```
   PORT=3000
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   CACHE_TTL=3600
   ```
   *(Replace with your actual OpenAI API key.)*

## 4. Start the Backend Server
```sh
node server.js
```
- The server should run on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## 5. Install Chrome Extension
1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
2. Enable **Developer mode** (top right).
3. Click **Load unpacked**.
4. Select the `ecoticker-extension` folder inside your project directory.

## 6. Using the Extension
- Navigate to a supported product page (e.g., Nike).
- Click the EcoTicker extension icon.
- Click **Analyze Sustainability**.
- Wait for the score and summary to appear.

## 7. Troubleshooting
- **If you see "Lack of Information" or errors:**
  - Make sure your backend server is running.
  - Ensure your `.env` file exists and contains a valid OpenAI API key.
  - Check the terminal for backend errors.
  - Make sure you have run `npm install` in the `server` directory.
  - Ensure the product page is accessible and not region-locked.

## 8. For Collaborators
- Each user must create their own `.env` file with their own OpenAI API key.
- Each user must run `npm install` in the `server` directory after cloning or pulling updates.

## 9. (Optional) Updating Dependencies
If you ever update `package.json`, run:
```sh
npm install
```
again in the `server` directory.

**That's it! Your EcoTicker extension and backend should now be fully functional.**
